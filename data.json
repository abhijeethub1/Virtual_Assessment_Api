      "content": "<p>So , the thing is , I have an issue in my life and am looking for its solution , tried everywhere so I  just though leme try here too ,maybe it would be worth putting. This post is going to be quite off topic as its category and will be very long so read only if u like reading and have some spare time , had been procrastinating to write but don’t have any other option left ( also do leme know if it infringes any policies will delete asap) . So as my roll no hints that I m from may 2023 batch , but I m still in my foundation lvl , probably the worst phase of my life . The thing is I am  a PMO addict since I was just a kid (indirect to direct) due to bad company and inner curiosity . Leme cover BG:  Raised up in a middle class family in Mumbai  Slums and both of my parents work so I used to stay alone at home and TV,phone,PC aggravated my condition . i realized there itself but was quite young to make any judgement and kept on doing as it was giving me joy , and my inquisitiveness was growing day by day making it more natural to me . I tried to stop in between but was quite undetermined though the frequency was lesser that time , time passed by and so its data in my mind which used to give me flashbacks everytime I tried to give up it , then came my  10 boards , as was easy so I somehow scored 90% , my parents were happy( me too but I felt could have done better) and with this thought we decided to give a try to JEE ,  I had thought will study seriously  but due to corona(2020-21)  had to come to village so my foundations were quite weak , gave boards but managed only 66% ,(gave improvement , didn’t work as went to kota , travelling and more)  I barely passed maths  ( the addiction was one of major reasons) I still thought of giving one more try so my parents sent me to kota by taking loan , I was quite pressurized cuz even in such a situation I was not able to quit my addiction ( loneliness , other studs enoying , homesickness , OVERTHINKING , laziness etc) .  I attended all the lectures and did studied hard but drop year is something very tough if u didn’t study much in 11-12th  , I mastered chemistry and physics too to some extent , but couldn’t do maths , though scored fine in mains but failed in adv .  But then news came that 75% is back so my NIT dreams too got thrashed , I thought everything ended for me except a pvt clg on another loan but then I got to know about this degree ( very thankful to IITM) took admission before adv . I am in a village in Up now ( little issues like family stuffs and light though excuses) . Now I decided to focus completely on this degree but ( my strong parts chem and phy are of no use to me know ) and I struggled with maths and stats even programming as its new to me . It’s my 6th term of foundation now, the last hope . leme breakdown:</p>\n<p>1st T : all 4 subs jee based   couldn’t study  adv and travelling             2n T : became campus ambassador , but passed with 6 cgpa ,   3rdT : stats2 , maths 2 , Python , couldn’t study well due to addiction , ,illness  and OPPE so thought  lets do all 3 to improve CGPA<br>\n4th Term : all 3 again OPPE halted me ,  5th Term : all 3 + CT impr( improved only 1 grade) , 6th current Term : all 3 + stats 1 impr  ,   whatever I have done in my life this addiction has always been a part of it ( though other factors too but this was the major one) I read tons of articles , saw 100s of recovery videos , read books like easy peasy method , used blockers and extensions , started exercise and meditation  but being from tech always found a way to escape through  ,  I do it every 2nd or 3 day on avg ( sometimes more than once) now I feel like I was wasted my life so far cuz I am 20 now , became twice junior to my batchmates ,  can’t see any way ,    being in a community with so many people who are somewhat successful and at least doing something better , I beg u all to plz suggest me something , rebuke me , abuse me , do whatever but I literally wanna get out of this trap and wanna do something better in my life , I don’t use social media nor any other thing like cricket but this thing … I am quite ashamed to write  … but I feel maybe someone’s experience might help me  esp of experienced people like Anand sir , Karthik sir . If u read till here then I thank u with all my heart and wish u more success in life ! Thanks again .</p>",

You know, we all have hard phases in life where we have to go through troublesome incidents and a lot of being ashamed of ourselves along with self doubt (this one sticks hard!).</p>\n<p>You might have tried to improve your situations by your actions but they might have fallen short. You might not have been able to achieve what you set out to achieve.</p>\n<p>It happens. It happens to everyone bro. It happened even to me! But don’t worry.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with small steps. Don’t set goals like I want to pass maths 2 or stats 2. It’s a bit a vague, but rather tell yourself that you’re going to learn the concepts of Maths 2 and Stats 2.<br>\nTry other programming resources like w3schools or <a href=\"http://freecodecamp.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">freecodecamp.org</a> or even apna college youtube channel. They teach you very well.<br>\nI’m open to help you bro! Because I understand that you want to grow and prove yourself, not to anyone, but you.</p>\n<p>I get that you’re feeling low in your life now, but this too shall pass. I recommend listening to few self help episodes  ‘Daily Wisdom’. They kind of help you. Even I’m starting out my offline college, so i understand the 11th and 12th phase.</p>\n<p>I know that I’ve never met you. I don’t know whether this helps you, just know that there are people who are facing the same phase of life with you right now. We just don’t share it out loud. It doesn’t mean that we’re not hurting.</p>\n<p>Start some physical activities like walking, jogging or even running and exercise. They’ll help you keep positive thoughts about yourself.</p>\n<p>I can’t guarantee that feeling positive about yourself will help you make your situations better, but I can guarantee you that feeling worst about yourself WILL MAKE  your situations even worse.</p>\n<p>You will having a thriving life in future, just persevere this hard phase.<br>\nLIFE IS GOOD BRO, give it some time.</p>\n<p>HAVE A GREAT DAY ahead !!!</p>",

You know, we all have hard phases in life, but the thing is that how we tackle from those problems.<br>\nYou might have tried to improve your situations by your action but now you have to put some more efforts.<br>\nFirstly, do Meditation with Positive thoughts like \" I am a Pure Soul, I am intelligent Soul, I am able to complete my syllabus, I am able to score 9+ CGPA, I am able to become , I am able to Overcome from PMO addiction\" in your mother tongue.<br>\nSecond, start your Course within present like when you are study math’s at that time only study and don’t think about that you have to pass or math is tough for me or my basic is weak, don’t think about this and that time only focus on the content and by meditation you’ll achieve the focus slowly.<br>\nThird, try to make new account on social media and in settings enable strict mode so, you don’t see any irrelevant content and try not to be alone and make yourself busy because if you free then your thoughts go in that side so, try to make yourself busy.<br>\nFourth, try to sleep early and wake early morning 4:00 AM or 5:00 AM and don Meditation and then after Study.<br>\nFifth, in morning go for Walk or jogging (not running because by doing running, you’ll tired), by which you feel fresher.<br>\nSixth, try to go worship place (according to your faith) at least in a month once and if possible then every week would be more helpful.<br>\nSeventh, try to be Positive in every situation because in failure also you got some experience while will help to make better decision in future for your Success &amp; Remember that Failure is the Part of Success.</p>\n<p>I don’t know your and never met you but I’m sure that these points will definitely help you to tackle with your situation.

Some people find success in overcoming it by themselves with a drastic change of routine and such. But in particular cases, when one genuinely feels like nothing they have tried is working, professional intervention might be needed. While the collective wisdom of a forum like this is sufficiently motivating, you might have to seek medical help. Subject to financial constraints, talk to a psychiatrist. Of course, listen to what others have to say here, but seeking professional help just might be the best option for you as they are likely to be far more experienced and qualified to help you than folk who are themselves relatively “doing well”.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Is this the real problem? The addiction you are taking about is surely a issue , but it cannot be a issue so overwhelming as you said.</p>\n<p>How can addiction make you poor in mathematics but good in physics n chemistry?!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I would personally not like to correlate your addiction to your performance in IIT M. But I guess there are other factors involved , maybe your lonely, depressed , abuse for some reasons and that’s is where the problem lies. Or maybe you simply don’t like these subjects , this is not ur forte. Whatever is the reason you have to figure it out.Even maybe the things are tough for u , and your brain is not liking to work harder. Though the addiction affects and harm you education, but years after years it spiralling you down seems little exaggerated. It may not be porn specifically but what triggers it , why the trigger is question!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Find out the reasons which actually doesn’t allow you to focus when u are studying, what happens when you start studying, what difficulty do you face during studying etc etc? List them, work on them…this platform I would say you would have to best kind of support… People go out of the way to help each other to study</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Coming to the addiction part. It is like a chain , it has a trigger, action and reaction. These goes on…</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is an example of how it works…</p>\n<p>Maybe your in your room alone the privacy is the trigger, your brain wants to be happy always , it needs dopamine for it.</p>\n<p>The brain knows watching porn (lets address it as it should be) will make it happy , it can release the dopamine. So u make the action.</p>\n<p>Reaction - dopamine release you are happy.</p>\n<p>The cycle is on.</p>\n<p>Oh! Remember the dopamine release gets saturated, I mean the body then feels no excitement with the release of a certain amount of it as it is adjusted. So option , release more of it. How? You are more addicted , more things trigger you to watch porn !</p>\n<p>So check the trigger points , and try to avoid them. Those cannot be avoid , try  changing the action to the trigger. Do something else , go for a walk , pinch yourself lightly, read a chapter from a good book , write a poetry etc etc.</p>\n<p>PS: I am not health care professional or related to psychology or its allies fields. Please take the advice as a peer advice and act accordingly.</p>\n<p>I could strongly recommend you to consult psychiatrist if possible. Public institutions provide for free it finance is a constraint. Try e Sanjeevani of government for free tele medicine consult.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hey there,<br>\nMy name’s Adnan and I completely empathize with your situation. Reading your post, I can see that quite a lot has happened for you and feeling depressed is pretty natural given the circumstances.</p>\n<p>You’re just 20-21, to be honest - life isn’t ending and you’re just a decision away from an entirely different life. While it can be difficult to combat any form of addiction, especially one you mentioned - Let me tell you it’s not impossible.</p>\n<p>There are tonnes of practical advice that can be given for quitting addiction, but let me just begin by saying; that <em><strong>‘its entirely alright, what you’re feeling is natural and with time, it will pass, you will evolve and be a much different person’</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Having addressed your need for reassurance, here’s some practical advice</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Reevaluate your life on a serious note - it’s okay to feel lost, what’s not okay is to give up sight of <em>‘what’</em> you want to achieve in the long run. When you’re driven by a solid goal, it’ll become your guiding post, your north star - every time you’re feeling lost, reevaluate with your goals and begin again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start reading books on how habits are built. All habits - good and bad, are only a set of behaviors that are triggered due to certain cues and indulging in the habit gives you a ‘reward’. You’re a brilliant student, see habits in a scientific manner and you’ll also find a way to alter/break or create new ones. I’ll recommend two good books on habits</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The Power of Habits - Charles Duhigg</li>\n<li>Atomic Habits - James Clear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start by reading these, you’ll come out much smarter on how to improve your life</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Lastly, as cliche as it sounds, life is not a rat race. You have your journey to walk and other have theirs. The grass on the other side always looks greener but the truth is, everyone has their own set of challenges in life. Also don’t forget the massive effort and hard work your parents have put behind you - just to see you succeed in life, and achieve things that were too far-fetched for them. If anything, you have to succeed for them, break the generational curse.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep your head up, you can do it</p>\n<p>Here are two cents of advice from someone much older than you. If you feel the need to talk or would like to discuss some practical ways to improve - feel free to drop a message <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",
